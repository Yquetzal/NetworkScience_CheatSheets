\begin{textbox}{Drawing graphs}
Drawing a graph can be useful to understand its structure. For instance, when confronted with the graph below, one can make the following observation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Everyone is not connected to everyone
    \item The graph is not regular
    \item Nodes 0, 32, 33 have a large degree while nodes 11,26, etc. have low degrees
    \item Some groups of nodes seem to be \textit{far away} from others, e.g., 4,5,6 are far from 14,15,18
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
