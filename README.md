# Network Science Cheatsheets
In this repository, I share the Network Science Cheatsheet, and all original content to generate them: .tex sources, figure files and notebooks to recreate most of the figures.

## What are the Network Science Cheatsheets ?
They are a set of compact resources to use as support for a Network Science class. I created them as the written support of my Network Science class at ENS de Lyon and University Lyon 1. (http://cazabetremy.fr/Teaching/ComplexNetworks.html)

They are intended for a public without any particular prior konwledge, since students following the class are from various backgrounds (computer science, physics, Biology, Cognitive Science), and I use some of these resources in other classes involving either more varied profiles (economists, Information Sciece, social scientists...)

## Can I reuse this material for my own class, a presentation, or another usage ?
Yes ! That's the whole point of sharing it here. When I was trying to create my class, I was often embarrassed because we are not supposed to reuse scientific article contents without aksing authorisations. So I created my own material, including original images (or, sometimes, borrowing images available under creative commons licenses.)

## I spotted an error in the Cheatsheet...
That's embarassing... But the good news is that you can correct it! Plase inform me, or even better, makes directly a pull request on the repository, and I'll make the change. 

## There is nothing about *Insert Topic Here*, it would be nice to have a cell/Cheatsheet on that
I have made a lot of arbitrary choices when creating those documents, and I myself I'm far from satisfied about them. If you have idea to improve those cheatsheets or to create new ones, feel free to give a hand. If you create something nice, I will be glad to host it here. New/Better pictures, clarifications on some aspects or relevant references would also be very welcome.
